<p><strong>Hydrogen Cars Australia Cost</strong>, At $3.50 per gallon of gas, a regular vehicle would cost $0.13 per mile but a hydrogen car using $8.00 per kg of fuel would cost $0.12 per mile. Green hydrogen costs are expected to fall as quickly as solar and battery storage, but australia needs more things to go its way if it is to create a huge export industry for clean fuels. Hydrogen fuel cell cars are the bad idea that refuses to die, zombies revenant from their ~2005 grave, lurching forward into transportation discussions over and over.</p>

<p>Today, 95 percent of hydrogen used for industry is extracted from fossil fuels. The hydrogen production costs from electrolysis are influenced by the capital costs of the electrolyzer, its utilization and the (average) electricity purchase price during the time of operation. The australian capital territory is poised to take delivery of the first of 20 hyundai nexo “fuel cell” cars early next year once the installation of its hydrogen refuelling station is complete. Fuel cell cars themselves are more expensive to purchase new, and the hydrogen fuel costs work out to roughly $5.60 a gallon today according to the california fuel cell partnership. The most abundant element in the universe is hydrogen. The hydrogen car still holds an electric battery like conventional electric cars.(supplied: Pin by 郭 星 on Xtrail Nissan, Motor car, Suv.</p>
